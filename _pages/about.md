🏫 I recently graduated from RBC, major in Music Technology.

🔬 My research interests include immersive audio, psychoacoustics, and multimodal machine learning.

👨‍💻 I am currently working on my team project: a 2D RPG Card Game"Be My Guest" [Check our itch page](https://gjmxcrossover.itch.io/bemyguest).

🎯 I'm also looking for like-minded audio professionals to join my new project: creating a **screenless immersive role-playing game** for the visually impaired. 


# Selected Experience

## Works & Projects

### 🎼 Music Producer
I have worked as a music producer for 6 years. Contributed to multiple projects including: [Still the Same Appearance](https://music.163.com/#/album?id=92041057) , [Chopsticks](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1484710060) and a lot of concerts & live shows.



### 🎮 Game Audio Engineer
I have been working as an audio engineer for 3 years. Mostly working with 2D Games. Contributed in [Girl’s Wonderful Journey](https://www.gcores.com/games/125872), [Relignition](https://www.gcores.com/games/105435),[Listen](https://wanghai9963.itch.io/listen) and something else.


### 📖 Novel Writer
18 years novel writing history🤣. The Book [Morigen Collection](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/%E8%8E%AB%E6%97%A5%E6%9B%B4%E9%9B%86/id6498863205) is already published on Apple Books. [Ten Thousand Uses of Plants and Animals I Develop in Another World](https://fanqienovel.com/page/7289285570956626959?enter_from=search) is still being updated.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
During my time at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, I conducted research under the guidance of **Professor Lamberto Coccioli**, titled **"User Interface Design of DSP Dynamic Range Compression Processors and Their Impact on User Experience."** This study focused on exploring how interface design influences the usability and efficiency of dynamic range compression processors in digital signal processing.

The findings of my research provided valuable insights into the relationship between user interface design and the overall user experience, particularly within the context of audio production tools. The resulting paper has been accepted for publication in the *Academic Journal of Humanities & Social Sciences*, contributing to the growing body of work on human-computer interaction in music technology.

## 📚 Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Music Technology community, I have a [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mell-weng) page *where I publish educational content.* and a [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/18668917?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) channel *where I translate educational materials*.
