I wrote this piece for a friend of mine who died of cyberbullying. Before her death she was a very good piano teacher and was verbally abused by people online for dyeing her hair pink, among other reasons. She was about my age, and after knowing about it, I finally decided to write a solo piano piece for her after much thought. As a memorial only.
