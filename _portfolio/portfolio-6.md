"Be My Guest" is a 2D role-play strategy game where players play as Zhuo, a girl from an ancient hunting tribe, on a turn-based hunting adventure. The materials gained from hunting monsters are used both as weapons in combat and as ingredients to cook dishes that enhance Zhuo's abilities. As the game progresses, Zhuo reaches a town where she uses the ingredients to entertain friends, discovering their diets, lives, and stories through dinner conversations. Dishes carry human desires, emotions, and memories. In the cycle of hunting and partying, searing the flavors of memories, the lost homeland and the truth of the demonic flood are waiting to be revealed.
